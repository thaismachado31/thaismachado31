Passionate about logic and fast thinking. Throughout my professional experiences, I’ve noticed that more than good logical thinking I’m very passionate about being in creative spaces, and that are always seeking innovation and creating a unique and healthy experience for everybody, from employees to clients.

I am a very detailed-oriented person, relentlessly seeking improvement in my work, focusing on efficiency and quality. When I started my journey in the programming world those were some points that I saw that were going to be very useful for coding. Besides that I work best with people, it is so much more enriching, and it gives more space for new ideas and innovation to come, as we can hear from different perspectives and experiences.

I started my work experience in Architecture, with the idea that I would combine creativity with logic, but mostly challenge myself on the creative side. In that experience, I understood that creativity is not exclusively art, and that changed the course of my life, leading me to web development. In the coding world, I could challenge myself constantly, work massively with logic and be creative in a new way!
